## Project Information:
- Author: Nhut Nguyen (also the owner of this repository under the name of nhut-ntm)
- Email: nhutntmuel@gmail.com
- This project is part of my graduation thesis. 

## Techniques used in this project
- Language: Python, SQL
- Data collection, Data manipulation, Machine Learning 

## Roadmap
There are some updates are under way 
1. Create new modules: 
    - There are some functions shared between notebooks. Therefore, creating `.py` files to contain these functions will be improve reusability 
2. Add a file to describe the methodology and results in detail

## Navigation through this repository 
1. Folder `data/processed_datasets`: contains datasets after preprocessing and feature engineering stages.
2. Folder `data/raw_datasets`: contains raw, newly collected data including USDVND exchange rates, XAUUSD gold prices, and selling prices of SJC gold tael bar.
3. Folder `data_collection`: contains notebooks and SQL script to collect, retrieve, and merge data including USDVND exchange rates, XAUUSD gold prices, and selling prices of SJC gold tael bar.
4. Folder `data_preprocessing`: contains a notebook to preprocess and perform feature engineering 
5. Folder `models`: contains notebooks for building models 
6. Folder `results`: contains forecasts generated by models
